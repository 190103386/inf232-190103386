My name is Aruzhan. I'm 18 years old. My hobby is to sing and eating! See you after quarantine!
My full name is Shamshayeva Aruzhan. I was born in Kazakhstan, Aktobe in 2002. I'm 18 years old. About my appearance, I'm tall and thin (probably), I have brown eyes and dark brown hair. About my character, I am very friendly, but only with people that I think are quite good. I happen really impatient and curious, but I do not consider it a disadvantage. Do not know whether to write. I think I've told everything about myself. I do not think my life is boring because every day confronted with something new and interesting for me. For example: meeting new people at school or a meeting with the best friends.
That's all!
Goodbye!
